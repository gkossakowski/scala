/*
 * The new, sbt-based build definition for Scala.
 *
 * What you see below is very much work-in-progress. Basics like compiling and packaging jars
 * (into right location) work. Everything else is missing:
 *    building docs, placing shell scripts in right locations (so you can run compiler easily),
 *    running partest test, compiling and running JUnit test, and many, many other things.
 *
 * You'll notice that this build definition is much more complicated than your typical sbt build.
 * The main reason is that we are not benefiting from sbt's conventions when it comes project
 * layout. For that reason we have to configure a lot more explicitly. I've tried explain in
 * comments the less obvious settings.
 *
 * This nicely leads me to explaning goal and non-goals of this build definition. Goals are:
 *
 *   - to be easy to tweak it in case a bug or small inconsistency is found
 *   - to mimic Ant's behavior as closely as possible
 *   - to be super explicit about any departure from standard sbt settings
 *   - to achieve functional parity with Ant build as quickly as possible
 *   - to be readable and not necessarily succint
 *   - to provide the nicest development experience for people hacking on Scala
 *
 * Non-goals are:
 *
 *   - to have the shortest sbt build definition possible; we'll beat Ant definition
 *     easily and that will thrill us already
 *   - to remove irregularities from our build process right away
 *   - to modularize the Scala compiler or library further
 *
 * It boils down to simple rules:
 *
 *   - project laytout is set in stone for now
 *   - if you need to work on convincing sbt to follow non-standard layout then
 *     explain everything you did in comments
 *   - constantly check where Ant build produces class files, artifacts, what kind of other
 *     files generates and port all of that to here
 *
 * Note on bootstrapping:
 *
 *   Let's start with reminder what bootstrapping means in our context. It's an answer
 *   to this question: which version of Scala are using to compile Scala? The fact that
 *   the question sounds circular suggests trickiness. Indeed, bootstrapping Scala
 *   compiler is a tricky process.
 *
 *   Ant build used to have involved system of bootstrapping Scala. It would consist of
 *   three layers: starr, locker and quick. The sbt build for Scala ditches layering
 *   and strives to be as standard sbt project as possible. This means that we are simply
 *   building Scala with latest stable release of Scala.
 *   See this discussion for more details behind this decision:
 *     https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/gp5JsM1E0Fo/discussion
